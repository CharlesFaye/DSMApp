this is an application dedicated to the agricultural sector 

##Getting Started 

I designed this app in order to help the agricultural sector of my country
which faces several difficulties such as the difficulty to market the 
products after reaping them or the lack of 
applications who are dedicated to the agricultural sector. So I have 
this beautifal idea in my degree background to devise an app who will help
the farmers improve their productions and doing better job.
